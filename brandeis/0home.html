        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Policy Manager is the privacy settings feature of Privacy-Enhanced Android (PEAndroid), which is a DARPA-funded project seeking to improve the privacy of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). The Policy Manager allows users of PEAndroid to learn and control sensitive permissions associated with the use of a mobile phone to various levels of granularity and depth. The main aspect of the privacy settings is to explain to users:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>What data is being accessed (permissions)</li>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Camera, Location, Microphone, etc.</li>
        	</ul>
        	<li>Why it is being accessed (purpose)</li>
        	<ul>
        		<li>For Advertising, For Navigation, etc.</li>
        	</ul>
        	<li>Who is accessing the data exactly (internal use vs third-party use)</li>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Company of the app, Third-Party Ad-Networks associated with the app, etc.</li>
        	</ul>
        </ul>

        <p><br><br>The policy manager is divided into the following parts:<br>
        </p>
        

        <h2>Home Screen</h2> 
        <p>It presents the user with the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Information about sensitive data collected on their device over some period of time</li>
			<li>Recommendations on privacy policy settings based on previously configured settings</li>
			<li>Navigation to app or global settings</li>
			<li>Menu, which allows users to navigate to the organizational profile screen</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
        <p>(The chart presenting sensitive data is currently not implemented in the released version. Recommendations are currently not implemented in the released version.)<br><br><br></p>

        
        <h2>App Settings</h2>
        <p>These are settings that apply to one single app. This screen will appear to a user in one of two scenarios:
        	<ul>
        		<li>When the user first installs an app</li>
        		<li>When the user navigates there via the home screen or a notification</li>
        	</ul>
        </p>
		<p>Permissions in app settings are divided into two categories:
			<ul>
				<li>App Internal Use: The data requested will be used by the app itself, or could be sent off of the device and possibly kept within the servers that the app communicates with. The data should not be shared with any external parties.</li>
				<li>Third Party Use: The data requested will be shared with parties external to the company who developed this app. Typically, the data is being used for advertising or analytics purposes.</li>
			</ul>
			Third party policy setting cards also give the user the option to configure based on specific third party, if they press on the 'advanced' link.<br><br>
			App settings may report that there may be no third party access, but it is possible the policy manager will detect third party access during the course of app use. If this happens, the user will be presented with a prompt to decide on a policy for this access.<br><br>
			App settings are user settings, and thus are enforced with the lowest priority in CMUs policy enforcement algorithm. This means they are overridden by any active policy profiles, and quick settings. They are also subject to the 'most recent setting wins' rule, where a user setting most recently configured is the policy that is enforced.<br><br><br>
		</p>


		<h2>Global Settings</h2>
		<p>Global settings allow you to quickly apply a policy setting across all apps for a permission for all purposes at once. You may also configure a setting for all third party use for a purpose and permission across all apps.<br><br>

		Global settings are a form of user policy, and thus are enforced with the lowest priority in the CMU policy enforcement algorithm. They are overridden by both policy profiles and quick settings. They also obey the "most recent setting wins" rule, which means they could be overridden by an app policy as well.<br><br><br>
		</p>
		

		<h2>Recommendations</h2>
		<p>Recommendations are provided to users privacy policy settings as actions that can be taken to secure privacy for new/other apps based on past behavior and preference for privacy estimated from previously configured settings.<br><br><br>
		</p>


		<h2>Data Frequency Summary</h2>
		<p>The summary provides an overall and quick view of how one's data is being accessed over a period of time across multiple permissions.<br><br><br>
		</p>


		<h2>Quick Settings</h2>
		<p>Users may only care about a few very important sources of private information: camera, microphone and location. Instead of configuring these yourself, you may just tap a button instead. Quick settings give users a simple way to disable access to these sensitive data sources, quickly.<br><br>

		Quick settings are enforced with the second most priority, behind privacy profiles.<br><br><br>
		</p>


		<h2>Runtime UI</h2>
		<p>A user may decide to defer a policy decision, or may want to decide on a policy whenever that permission is actually requested in the app. If a user configures a policy setting to "ask", they will be presented with a prompt when the app requests the specified permission/purpose. The prompt will present the user with three options:
			<ul>
				<li>Only this time: Only this time, if selected, will temporarily remember your policy decision for five minutes. Once five minutes are up, the user will be prompted again for their policy decision if the app is still in use.</li>
				<li>Always Allow: Always Allow will always allow the data access being prompted. It effectively will change the user's policy setting to be from "ask" to "on".</li>
				<li>Always Deny: Always Deny works the same way Always Allow does, except it will deny access to the requested data.</li>
			</ul>
		Runtime UIs are a user setting, and thus are enforced with the lowest priority in CMU's policy enforcement algorithm. If a policy profile or quick setting are in effect, a runtime prompt will not be shown.<br><br><br>
		</p>


		<h2>Privacy Profiles</h2>
		<p>Quick settings and user settings are focused on protecting the privacy of an individual. Organizations such as a military base, or employees of an embassy have an interest in protecting everyone's privacy. Imagine the location data of all travelers being leaked to someone with malicious intent. Organizational profiles are intended to be an easy mechanism for users to activate a set of pre-configured privacy policies from a trusted source.<br>

		Every user has a privacy profile by default, which is used any time the policy manager is interacted with. Users may add a profile on the profile screen after navigating through the menu on the homescreen. Once a privacy profile is enabled, its settings are enforced with the highest priority. It overrides any existing policy a user has configured, including quick settings.<br>

		Organizational profiles are currently only a prototype in the policy manager. You can add a dummy profile by scanning any QR code. Ideally, there will be a process set up for the policy manager to find policy profiles. Additionally, there should be more stringent methods for allowing users to switch between different profiles. As it is implemented, users may switch between profiles as they please. In more serious situations, users should only be allowed to disable an organizational profile if they are authorized to.<br><br><br>
		</p>


		<h2>Privacy Enforcement Algorithms</h2>
		<p>Carnegie Mellon University has invented a privacy policy enforcement algorithm based on a set of different checks. These checks each have different priorities, and algorithms to determine which policy should be enforced. When an app requests sensitive data, PE Android will forward the data request to the policy manager.<br><br>
		When the policy manager gets this request, it will take the following steps:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>If the request came from a system app, we allow the access to ensure system stability. Denying access to the data could lead to the phone becoming non-responsive.</li>
				<li>If the request came from a regular user app, then we begin the policy enforcement algorithm:</li>
				If stack traces are provided, analyze them to determine the purpose of the data access
				<ul>
					<li>If a purpose could be determined, begin the policy profile check</li>
					<ul>
						<li>If an organizational profile is active, does the profile deny this data access for this purpose?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If the profile denies this access, then PE Android is notified to deny this access</li>
							<li>If the profile allows access, continue to step ii</li>
						</ul>
						<li>If the organizational profile is not active, continue on to step ii</li>
					</ul>
					<li>If the organizational profile allows access to this permission, check to see if this permission is denied by quick settings.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>If quick settings denies this access, then PE Android is notified</li>
					</ul>
					<li>At this point, the user settings are referenced. User settings consist of global settings and app settings. Which policy to enforce depends on the 'most recent setting wins' rule. This means that if a global setting was configured yesterday, and an app setting was configured today, then the app setting policy is what will be enforced if that is the app that requested the data. Global settings just offer a way for a user to quickly apply a setting across all apps, purposes and libraries. Global settings do not necessarily override an app setting.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>If the policy is denied or allowed, PE Android is notified to deny or allow access.</li>
						<li>If the policy is set to ask, then the user is presented with a prompt to make a decision right now on the data access.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If the user selects the 'always' option, then the policy manager will set the policy for this permission to either deny/allow (based on what the user selected) from ask. PE Android will be notified.</li>
							<li>If 'only this time' is selected, then the policy manager temporarily remembers this decision for five minutes. This means each time this app requests this permission/purpose/library tuple, the selected policy will be applied until five minutes is up. Once the timer is up, the user will be presented with the prompt again, if the app requests that data.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>PE Android is notified of either allow/deny based on what the user selects in the prompt.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			
			Additionally, each time PE Android is given an allow or deny policy, the user is notified via persistent notifications. They are notified of what app made the request, the data it requested, why it requested it and at what point in the policy enforcement algorithm the decision was made to allow or deny.<br><br><br>
