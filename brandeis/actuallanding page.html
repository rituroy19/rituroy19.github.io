        <h2>Policy Manager</h2>
        <p>The policy manager gives Android users fine-grained control over sensitive data accesses on their phones, and provides context for these accesses through purposes. The policy manager is built on top of PE for Android.</p>
        <p>See more: <a href="brandeis_home.html">Policy Manager</a></p><br><br>

        <h2>Coconut</h2>
        <p>Coconut is an Android Studio plugin developed using IntelliJ, which requires developers to annotate any kind of access or storage of privacy-sensitive user data. These annotations can then be used to generate privacy policies for end-users. It also provides additional guidelines for developers on better privacy practices and risks.</p>
        <p> See more: <a href="https://coconut-ide.github.io/">Coconut IDE</a></p>
        <p>There is a PE for Android-enabled version of Coconut, which generates policy files for the policy manager and integrates with the PE for Android SDK.</p>

        <h2>PrivacyGrade</h2>
        <p>PrivacyGrade assigns privacy grades to apps based on crowdsourced information on people’s privacy expectations. It also allows users to view more in-depth and detailed data regarding what data apps collect, for what reason and where that data goes.</p>
        <p> See more: <a href="http://privacygrade.org/">PrivacyGrade</a></p><br><br>

        <h2>PrivacyProxy</h2>
        <p>PrivacyProxy is an app that allows users to control privacy sensitivity settings by filtering sensitive data that leaves the device via the network.</p>

        <h2>PrivacyStreams</h2>
        <p>PrivacyStreams allows developers to write code that preserves a user’s privacy through an easy-to-use API based on Java streams.</p>
        <p> See more: <a href="https://github.com/PrivacyStreams/">PrivacyStreams</a></p>
        <p>There is a PE for Android-enabled version of PrivacyStreams, which serializes PrivacyStream queries as JSON objects, and executes the code remotely in a PE for Android PAL module. This version of PrivacyStreams guarantees additional privacy, because the code that accesses sensitive data is executed in a trusted source (the OS).</p>

        <h2>Protect My Privacy</h2>
        <p>Protect My Privacy is an app that allows users to control what data apps on their phone are allowed to collect. The Android version expands on the iOS version by allowing users to allow or deny sensitive data accesses to third-party libraries (such as advertisers), and includes a minimal purpose taxonomy.</p>
        <p> iOS: <a href="http://www.protectmyprivacy.org/">Download iOS App</a></p>
        <p> Android: <a href="http://www.android.protectmyprivacy.org/">Download Android App</a></p><br><br>

        <h2>UX Research and Design</h2>
        <p>Intensive user experience research and design led to the final development of architecture and interface of the policy manager. Many UX research methods were adopted and conducted that led to informing design decisions for the interface. You can find more details in the link below.</p>
