        <h1>Global Settings</h1>
        <p>Global settings allow you to quickly apply a policy setting across all apps for a permission for all purposes at once. You may also configure a setting for all third party use for a purpose and permission across all apps.<br><br>

		Global settings are a form of user policy, and thus are enforced with the lowest priority in the CMU policy enforcement algorithm. They are overridden by both policy profiles and quick settings. They also obey the "most recent setting wins" rule, which means they could be overridden by an app policy as well.
