    		<h4 style="padding-left: 40px">The net worth of the industry is around 35.5 billion US Dollars. In 2009, the aviation industry entered a golden age. Between 2009 and 2017, the revenue grew at a compund annual growth rate of 5.9% reaching 754 billion US Dollars in 2017.</h4>

This is exciting to see the dynamic change in the industry through this lens. Quite possibly, there can be some really interesting patterns of growth in different aspects.</h4>

	    	<h4 style="padding-left: 40px">Let's look at some of the busiest airports of the world since 2000 and how dramatically they have been changing. US clearly was the forerunner with majority passengers in the earlier years.</h4>
	    	<h4 style="padding-left: 40px">Over the years, Asian countries have seen the majority growth with countries like China and UAE offering most flights to majority passengers at cheaper rates!</h4>
	    	<h4 style="padding-left: 40px">Growth has fairly been constant for European countries. However, Atlanta airport remains to be at the top through the years, having a growth of about 3% passenegrs per year. It's still growing and is still unbeaten!</h4>
